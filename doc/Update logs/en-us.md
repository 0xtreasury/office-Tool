2. Support for verifying Office installation files.
3. Fixed an issue that when Office is downloaded, it does not send notification.
4. Fixed an issue where Office licenses were not updated after the deployment of Office was complete.
5. Fixed an issue of not getting the correct Monthly Enterprise Channel version, thanks to [Windows_Addict](https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/tool-office-tool-plus-v8-2-official-thread.82730/page-7#post-1666180).
